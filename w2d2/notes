code should be hard to read; anyone who doesn't understand it should leave it alone
this is, of course, facetious, but hinting at a truth
it is good to have complex, elegant private functions, and verbose, well-named public ones

avoid hard-coding when possible
exceptions can be used for control flow, [should they?]
